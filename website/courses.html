		<p style="font: italic bold 16px 'Times New Roman'">P532 - Object Oriented Software Development</p>

		<p>Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software problems. They are distilled design lessons, learned the hard way by vast numbers of developers over decades. They capture successful experiences and convey expert insight to beginners. A good alternate name might be "learn from my pain". This course is an in-depth introduction to design patterns, with a strong emphasis on project design and programming. Design and programming intensive, and uses java for presentation and analysis of design patterns and for assignments and projects.</p>
		<p>After a few weeks devoted to covering the basics of design patterns, extreme programming, unit testing, and refactoring, students will apply design patterns to a real software project and be expected to deliver a working product. Students will work in teams all term long. Students must be committed to delivering an elegant design, robust code, well-written documentation, and be able to present their work to an audience concisely and intelligibly. </p>


		<p style="font: italic bold 16px 'Times New Roman'">B501 - Thoery of computing</p>

		<p>Review induction, covers regular languages, context-free languages, Turing machines and linear-bounded automata (and Turing-recognizable and context-sensiteve languages). Then touches upon decidability and undecidability and results from reducibility. Finally time and space complexity classes.</p>

		<p style="font: italic bold 16px 'Times New Roman'">B534 - Distributed Systems</p>

		<p>This class uses modern systems to introduce core technologies including communication, concurrency/parallelism, security, fault tolerance and programming models. In particular the course covers systems and tools to support data intensive science applications. Knowledge about the latest research topics through paper readings and opportunity to understand some commercial cloud systems through projects using FutureGrid resources. </p>
		<p>The content covers the design principles, systems architecture, and innovative applications of parallel, distributed, and cloud computing systems. These include massively parallel processors (MPP), supercomputing clusters, service-orient architecture (SOA), computational grids, P2P (peer-to-peer) networks, virtualized datacenters, cloud platforms, Internet of Things (IOT), and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Covers MapReduce (originated from functional languages) and associated languages like DryadLINQ and Sawzall, focus more on the principles and practice of building distributed systems than on languages.</p>


		<p style="font: italic bold 16px 'Times New Roman'">B669 - Database and Internal Design</p>

		<p>Introduced to semi-sturctured and unstructured data, such as tree-structured data (XML), graph data (RDF, data on the web, social network, etc), unstructured data (text) and cutting-edge technologies for managing such data, including data models, queries languages, data storage and retrival techniques. Includes a research project in the area of database systems, focusing on idnetifying new problems and designing new algorithms for managing semi-structured and unstructured data.</p>

		<p style="font: italic bold 16px 'Times New Roman'">B649 - Cloud computing</p>

		<p>Several new computing paradigms are emerging from large commercial clouds. These include virtual machine based utility computing environments such as Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. Further there are also a set of new MapReduce programming paradigms coming from Information retrieval field which have been shown to be effective for scientific data analysis. This class covers many of the key concepts with a common set of simple examples. It is designed to prepare participants to understand and compare capabilities of these new technologies and infrastructure and to have a basic idea as to how to get started. Includes projects in Hadoop, Mapreduce, DryadLINQ and Twister.</p>

		<p style="font: italic bold 16px 'Times New Roman'">B689 - Topics in graphics & HCI - Math Modeling</p>

		<p>This course focused on Mathematica-based methods of producing rapid prototypes solving complex software modeling problems. This class starts with an introduction to the Mathematica programming environment, and incorporates Mathematica prototyping methods implicitly into a broad survey of mathematical modeling methods, techniques, and folklore used widely throughout computer science, computer graphics, scientific visualization, mathematics, and physics.</p>

		<p style="font: italic bold 16px 'Times New Roman'">P573 - Scientific Computing</p>

		<p>This course provides an overview of computer hardware, software, and numerical methods that are useful on scientific workstations and supercomputers. Topics include high-performance computer architectures, software tools and packages, characteristics of commonly used numerical methods, graphical presentation of results, and performance analysis and improvement.<p>
		<p>This course concentrates on 
			practical implementation of solutions of scientific problems on computers 
			the efficient mapping of solution methods to modern architectures, software tools and methods useful in modern scientific computing.
			the basic foundations of performance analysis, modeling, and prediction
